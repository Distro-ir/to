concept:
	this program is usefull to list your todo.
	enywhere this program run, it will make a file named '.to' in the
	directory that runed in.
	this file is the database of the program in a kind of json format, more
	like a dictionary in python.
	
	there are too many project that you contribute in them.
	and there are too many feacher that you should impiment.
	or there are a lots of bug that should fixed.
	whene you use a triditional todo-list manager. you have a file which 
	you write your todo in there and you have to indicate which task is for 
	what project.
	but with this program you dont need to do that. easy add your list
	in the directory of that project.
	and any time that you need to know what you should do for what project
	go to the progect directory and write the coresponding command.
	ok the concept of the .to file was just this. but what about the list?
	
	a to-list is use to list and seprate the task from each other.
	for example you have 5 bugs to fix and there are 6 feacher that should
	impliment to your project. with a list of 'to' you can easily add your
	task in the coresponding list. in this case we have bugs and feacher
	so we can have two list: fix and add
	in fix list we will add the bug which should fix.
	in add list we will add feacher that should add.
